Welcome to my personal site! I've been meaning to set this up for a while, and here we are.

## Why a personal site?

As a software engineer, I spend most of my time building things for others. This site is a space for me — a place to write about what I'm learning, share things I find interesting, and document my journey.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Backend development** — APIs, system design, things I've learned building production systems
- **Infrastructure** — cloud, containers, CI/CD, and the tooling that makes it all work
- **Learning in public** — notes from exploring new technologies and concepts

## Keep it simple

This site is intentionally minimal. No heavy frameworks, no unnecessary complexity — just content. That's the whole point.

Thanks for stopping by. More posts coming soon.
